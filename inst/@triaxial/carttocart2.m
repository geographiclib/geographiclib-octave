% The formulation is due to Ligas, Stud. Geophys. Geod. (2012).  The major
% difference is to use an improved starting guess for Newton's method which
% guarantees convergence.  Panou and Korakitis, J. Geod. (2022) use the
% bisection method to solve the same equation; but this requires many more
% iterations to converge compared to Newton's method.  Seom other points:
%
% * the method used here is simpler that PK (2022), in that there's no need
%   to treat special cases separately (indeed the method could easily be
%   generatlized to deal with ellipsoids in higher dimensions);
%
% * a couple of tricks are used to improve the numerical accuracy of Newton's
%   method: (a) the function is evaluated with extended precision to avoid
%   the loss of precision; (b) the independent variable is offset so that the
%   singularity in the function is at the origin;
%
% * this routine stops at finding the closest point and defer computing
%   latitudes and longitudes for that to point to other functions.
