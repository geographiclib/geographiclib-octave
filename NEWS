Changes in geographiclib-octave

Version 2.0 (release 2022-mm-dd)
  * Reorganized code base.
  * Fix bug where a geodesic with lat1 = 0 and lat2 = nan was treated
    as equatorial.
  * Better treatment of latitude = +/-0, longitude differences =
    +/-180, azimuths = +/-0 or +/-180.

Version 1.52 (released 2021-06-22)
  * Be more aggressive in preventing negative s12 and m12 for short
    lines (all languages).

Version 1.50 (released 2019-09-24)
  * BUG fixes:
    - fix bug in mgrs_inv which resulted in incorrect results for UPS
      zones with prec = -1;
    - in geodreckon and geoddistance, suppress (innocuous) "warning:
      division by zero" messages from Octave.
  * geodarea can now handle arbitrarily complex polygons.  In the case of
    self-intersecting polygons the area is accumulated "algebraically",
    e.g., the areas of the 2 loops in a figure-8 polygon will partially
    cancel.
  * private/cbrtx now preserves the sign of -0.
  * Improve code coverage in the tests.

Version 1.48 (released 2017-04-09)
  * The default range for longitude and azimuth is now (-180 deg, 180
    deg], instead of [-180 deg, 180 deg).
  * Fix BUG in geodreckon with mixed scalar and array arguments.

Version 1.47 (released 2017-02-15)
  * Improve accuracy of area calculation (fixing a flaw introduced in
    version 1.46).

Version 1.46 (released 2016-02-15)
  * More accurate solution of the inverse problem when longitude
    difference is close to 180 deg.

Version 1.45 (released 2015-09-30)
  * Fix array size mismatch in geoddistance by avoiding calls to
    subfunctions with zero-length arrays.
  * Fix tranmerc_{fwd,inv} so that they work with arrays and mixed
    array/scalar arguments.
  * Work around Octave problem which causes mgrs_fwd to return garbage
    with prec = 10 or 11.
  * Add geographiclib_test.m to run a test suite.

Version 1.44 (released 2015-08-14)
  * Various changes to improve accuracy, e.g., by minimizing round-off
    errors:
    - add sincosdx which take its arguments in degrees.  This does
      exact range reduction and thus they obey exactly the elementary
      properties of the trigonometric functions, e.g., sin 9 deg = cos
      81 deg = - sin 123456789 deg;
    - AngNormalize now works for any angles, instead of angles in
      the range [-540 deg, 540 deg);
    - this means that there is now no restriction on longitudes and
      azimuths; any values can be used;
    - improve the accuracy of atan2dx.
  * mgrs_fwd now treats treats prec &gt; 11 as prec = 11.
  * Illegal letter combinations are now correctly detected by mgrs_inv.
  * Fixed bug where mgrs_inv returned the wrong results for prec = 0
    strings and center = 0.
  * mgrs_inv now decodes prec = 11 strings properly.
  * Routines now return array results with the right shape.
  * Routines now properly handle mixed scalar and array arguments.

Version 1.43 (released 2015-05-23)
  * LONG_NOWRAP is now called LONG_UNROLL (a less negative sounding
    term).
  * Fixed a bad BUG in the implementation of this capability: it gave
    incorrect results for west-going geodesics.
  * mgrs_inv now takes an optional center argument and strips white
    space from both beginning and end of the string.

Version 1.42 (released 2015-04-28)
  * Reorganize directories, so that
    - matlab/geographiclib contains the native matlab code;
    - matlab/geographiclib-legacy contains wrapper functions to mimic
      the previous compiled functionality.
  * matlab/geographiclib is now packaged and distributed as MATLAB File
    Exchange package
     https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/50605
  * Point fix for geodarea.m to correct bug in area of polygons which
     encircle a pole multiple times.

Version 1.39 (released 2014-11-11)
  * Fix BLUNDER in area calculation in MATLAB routine geodreckon;
  * Add area calculation to routines for great ellipses.

Version 1.38 (released 2014-10-02)
  * MATLAB/Octave routines for great ellipses added.

Version 1.32 (released 2013-07-12)
  * Accumulate the perimeter and area of polygons via a double-wide
    accumulator.

Version 1.28 (released 2012-12-11)
  * add MATLAB implementations of the geodesic projections

Version 1.27 (released 2012-11-29)
  * add native MATLAB implementations: geoddistance.m, geodreckon.m,
    geodarea.m.
